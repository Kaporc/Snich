    <h1>Background</h1>
<p> Snich was born a goblin named Gurk. When he was still a mere goblin young his home was attacked by a high standing admiral and his crew purely for the sake of his hatred for goblins. <p> He was captured and brought onto the ship to be kept as a pet. He spent many years under the oppression of the pale-skins, learning their behavior and their ways. After watching them kill more and more goblins he detested their outlook on his kin.</p>

<p>After many years the crew was attacked by the Howling Siren pirates and in the midst of battle he managed to escape. But instead of seeking safety he sought out the admiral, who was hiding from the pirates.</p> <p>He found him and swiftly jumped him while stabbing a piece of driftwood in his neck.

The pirate captain Kirk "Rattail" O'Reilly admired his passion and offered him a job on his ship 'The Siren's Song'.</p> From that day on he threw away the name Gurk and named himself Snich, after the admiral he just murdered, asserting his dominance over the pale-skins by stealing his one true possession, his name.

But the crew never saw him as more than just an ankle-biter. But he was Reginald Grapplebeak, and he wanted the respect he felt he deserved. So he left his crew to find new ways on the land to bring him glory.</p>
